## Proven Sales Arguments

*Run the curl command*
"10 yacht matches found in 0.8 seconds, with automatic APA/VAT calculations."

### ROI Calculation:
- Manual: 10 leads Ã— 4 hours Ã— $50/hour = $2,000/week labor cost
- Automated: Same 10 leads processed in 10 minutes = $0 labor cost
- Savings: $8,000/month + higher conversion from faster response

### Closing Questions:
- "How much revenue do you lose from 4-hour response delays?"
- "What if you never missed another lead at night or weekends?"
