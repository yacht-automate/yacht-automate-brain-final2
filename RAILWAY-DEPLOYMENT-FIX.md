# Railway Deployment Fix - Build Process Solution

## Common Railway Build Failures & Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing Start Script
**Problem:** Railway can't find how to start your application
**Solution:** Add proper start commands

### Issue 2: TypeScript Compilation
**Problem:** Railway tries to compile TypeScript but fails
**Solution:** Use ts-node for direct execution

### Issue 3: Dependencies Missing
**Problem:** npm install fails during build
**Solution:** Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

## Fixed Configuration Files

### Updated railway.toml:
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[environments.production]
variables = { NODE_ENV = "production" }
```

### Alternative Start Methods:

**Method 1: Direct ts-node (Current)**
```bash
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

**Method 2: npm script (Recommended for Railway)**
Add to package.json scripts:
```json
"start": "npx ts-node src/index.ts"
```

**Method 3: Compiled JavaScript**
```json
"build": "npx tsc",
"start": "node dist/index.js"
```

## Debugging Railway Build Errors

### Common Error Messages:

**"No start command found"**
- Solution: Add startCommand in railway.toml
- Or add "start" script in package.json

**"Module not found"** 
- Solution: Run npm install locally to verify dependencies
- Check if all imports exist in src/ folder

**"TypeScript compilation failed"**
- Solution: Use ts-node instead of compiling
- Or fix TypeScript errors before deployment

**"Port binding failed"**
- Solution: Use process.env.PORT in your code
- Railway automatically assigns PORT environment variable

## Quick Railway Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload Fixed Files to GitHub
Your files now include:
- ✅ Fixed railway.toml with proper start command
- ✅ start.sh backup script
- ✅ All tier-enabled source code

### Step 2: Railway Environment Variables
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
ADMIN_KEY=yacht-automation-secure-2025-CHANGE-THIS
FROM_EMAIL=yacht-system@yourdomain.com
FROM_NAME=Yacht Charter Automation
```

### Step 3: Test Locally First
Before Railway deployment, verify it works:
```bash
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```
Should show: "Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:5000"

### Step 4: Deploy to Railway
1. Push fixed files to GitHub repository
2. Railway → New Project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Select your updated repository
4. Railway should build successfully

## Verification Commands After Deployment

```bash
# Health check
curl https://yourapp.railway.app/health

# Create test tenant
curl -X POST "https://yourapp.railway.app/admin/tenant" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: yacht-automation-secure-2025-CHANGE-THIS" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "test-customer",
    "name": "Test Customer",
    "tier": "starter"
  }'
```

## If Build Still Fails

### Get Railway Build Logs:
1. Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
2. Click failed deployment
3. View build logs for specific error
4. Share error message for targeted fix

### Alternative: Replit Deployment
If Railway continues to fail:
1. Use Replit's Deploy button instead
2. Get instant deployment without build issues
3. Custom domain still supported

Your tier-enabled yacht automation system is ready - these fixes should resolve the Railway build failures.
