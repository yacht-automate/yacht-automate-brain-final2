## Common Objections and Responses:

### "It's too expensive"
**Response**: "This system replaces a $60k/year employee who works 24/7. At $997/month, you break even in 2 weeks of time savings."

### "We need to think about it"
**Response**: "I understand. While you're thinking, you're losing leads to competitors who respond faster. How much is delayed response costing you monthly?"

### "Our current system works fine"
**Response**: "Fine means 4-hour response times while leads go to competitors. Would 60-second responses be better than fine?"

### "We don't have technical resources"
**Response**: "That's exactly why we handle everything - deployment, setup, and ongoing support. You just provide yacht data and we make it work."

### "What if it doesn't work?"
**Response**: "30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't save at least $2,000 in staff time the first month, full refund."
