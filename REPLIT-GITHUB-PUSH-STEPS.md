# Push Tier-Enabled Code from Replit to GitHub

## Now That GitHub is Connected

### Step 1: Use Replit's Git Interface
1. **Look for Git/Version Control tab** in left sidebar
2. **Stage all changes** - Click "+" next to modified files or "Stage all"
3. **Add commit message:** "Add tier-based pricing support with starter/pro/enterprise features"
4. **Click "Commit & Push"**

### Step 2: Verify Push to Production Repository
Check that your code went to: `github.com/yacht-automate/yacht-automate-brain-production`

**Your tier-enabled system should now include:**
- ✅ `src/tier-control.ts` - Tier management system
- ✅ Updated `src/types.ts` - Tier field in database schema  
- ✅ Updated `src/db.ts` - Tier database operations
- ✅ Updated `src/index.ts` - Tier-based access control
- ✅ `TIER-SETUP-GUIDE.md` - Customer tier management guide

## Step 3: Deploy to Railway Immediately

### Railway Deployment:
1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up with GitHub account**
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose `yacht-automate-brain-production`**
6. **Click "Deploy Now"**

### Railway Environment Variables:

ADMIN_KEY=yacht-automation-secure-2025-CHANGE-THIS
PORT=5000
ALLOWED_DOMAIN=*

FROM_NAME=Yacht Charter Automation
```

## Step 4: Test Your Live Tier System

### Create Test Customers:
```bash
# Starter customer ($99/month)
curl -X POST "https://yourapp.railway.app/admin/tenant" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: yacht-automation-secure-2025-CHANGE-THIS" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "starter-test",
    "name": "Starter Test Company",
    "tier": "starter",
    "fromEmail": "demo@startercompany.com"
  }'

# Pro customer ($299/month)  
curl -X POST "https://yourapp.railway.app/admin/tenant" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: yacht-automation-secure-2025-CHANGE-THIS" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "pro-test",
    "name": "Pro Test Company", 
    "tier": "pro",
    "fromEmail": "reservations@procompany.com"
  }'

# Enterprise customer ($599/month)
curl -X POST "https://yourapp.railway.app/admin/tenant" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: yacht-automation-secure-2025-CHANGE-THIS" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "enterprise-test",
    "name": "Enterprise Test Company",
    "tier": "enterprise", 
    "fromEmail": "concierge@enterprisecompany.com"
  }'
```

### Test Tier Restrictions:
```bash
# This should FAIL (Starter tier can't access analytics)
curl -X GET "https://yourapp.railway.app/dashboard/analytics" \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: starter-test"
# Expected: {"error": "Feature requires Pro or Enterprise tier"}

# This should WORK (Pro tier has analytics access)
curl -X GET "https://yourapp.railway.app/dashboard/analytics" \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: pro-test"
# Expected: Full analytics data

# This should WORK (Enterprise has all features)
curl -X GET "https://yourapp.railway.app/dashboard/analytics" \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: enterprise-test"
# Expected: Full analytics data
```

## Your Commercial System is Ready
