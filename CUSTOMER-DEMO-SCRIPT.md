## 2-Minute Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds):
**"Let me show you how your yacht charter leads get processed automatically..."**

**Show them the URL**: "This is your live automation system running 24/7"
**Point out**: "Status: operational - never goes offline"

### Main Demo (90 seconds):

**Step 1**: "Watch me submit a real customer inquiry"

**Copy this into your browser address bar**:

```

**Add this header manually** (or use curl):
```
X-Tenant-Id: demo-live
```

**Or use this curl command in terminal**:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://ee7a4fef-0f74-462a-aad3-47e18486837e-00-q8l8bnn3uavd.picard.replit.dev/yachts?area=Mediterranean&guests=8&limit=5" -H "X-Tenant-Id: demo-live"
```

**Step 2**: "Now let me process a full customer lead"

```bash
curl -X POST "https://ee7a4fef-0f74-462a-aad3-47e18486837e-00-q8l8bnn3uavd.picard.replit.dev/lead" \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: demo-live" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "name": "Sarah Johnson",
    "notes": "Mediterranean yacht for 6 guests, luxury amenities, budget â‚¬120k",
    "partySize": 6,
    "location": "Mediterranean",
    "budget": 120000
  }'
```

**Step 3**: Show the results
"Found 10 yacht matches in under 1 second, automatically calculated quotes with APA and VAT"

### Closing (30 seconds):
**"This entire process took 60 seconds. Your current manual process takes how long?"**
