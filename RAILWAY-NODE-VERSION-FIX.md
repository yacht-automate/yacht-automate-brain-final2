# Railway Node.js Version Fix - SOLVED

## The Problem:
Railway was using Node.js 18, but your dependencies require Node.js 20+:
- `better-sqlite3@12.2.0` requires Node.js 20.x || 22.x || 23.x || 24.x
- `find-my-way@9.3.0` requires Node.js >=20

## The Solution Applied:

### ✅ Fixed railway.toml:
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[build.env]
NODE_VERSION = "20"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npx ts-node src/index.ts"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[environments.production]
variables = { NODE_ENV = "production" }
```

### ✅ Added .nvmrc file:
```
20
```
This tells Railway/Nixpacks to use Node.js 20.

## Now Railway Will:
1. **Use Node.js 20** instead of 18
2. **Install dependencies successfully** - better-sqlite3 will work
3. **Build without Python errors** - native dependencies will compile
4. **Start your app** with the proper TypeScript command

## Next Steps:

### Push These Files to GitHub:
- ✅ `railway.toml` (updated with Node 20)
- ✅ `.nvmrc` (specifies Node 20)
- ✅ All your tier-enabled source code

### Railway Deployment Should Work Now:
```bash
# After pushing to GitHub and deploying to Railway:
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}
```

## Test Your Tier System After Deployment:

### Create Test Customers:
```bash
# Starter tier ($99/month)
curl -X POST "https://your-app-name.railway.app/admin/tenant" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: your-admin-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "starter-test",
    "name": "Starter Customer", 
    "tier": "starter"
  }'

# Pro tier ($299/month) 
curl -X POST "https://your-app-name.railway.app/admin/tenant" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: your-admin-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "pro-test",
    "name": "Pro Customer",
    "tier": "pro"
  }'

# Enterprise tier ($599/month)
curl -X POST "https://your-app-name.railway.app/admin/tenant" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: your-admin-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "enterprise-test", 
    "name": "Enterprise Customer",
    "tier": "enterprise"
  }'
```

### Test Tier Restrictions:
```bash
# Should FAIL (Starter can't access analytics)
curl "https://your-app-name.railway.app/dashboard/analytics" \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: starter-test"
# Returns: {"error": "Feature not available in starter tier"}

# Should WORK (Pro can access analytics)  
curl "https://your-app-name.railway.app/dashboard/analytics" \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: pro-test"
# Returns: Analytics data
```
