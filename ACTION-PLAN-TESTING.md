# ðŸ§ª STEP 3: TEST WITH REAL DATA

## Real Charter Company Data Integration

### 1. Yacht Inventory Data Collection

**Data Format Requirements:**
```json
{
  "yachtData": [
    {
      "name": "SERENITY",
      "builder": "Sunseeker",
      "length": "88",
      "guests": "12",
      "cabins": "5",
      "crew": "6", 
      "yearBuilt": "2019",
      "weeklyRate": "125000",
      "currency": "EUR",
      "area": "Mediterranean",
      "type": "Motor Yacht",
      "description": "Luxurious 88ft Sunseeker with modern amenities",
      "features": ["Beach Club", "Jacuzzi", "Water Toys", "WiFi"],
      "images": ["https://example.com/yacht1.jpg"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Data Sources to Target:**
- Fraser Yachts API
- Burgess yacht listings
- Northrop & Johnson inventory
- Independent charter companies' Excel files

**Data Collection Process:**
1. Contact charter companies for sample data
2. Convert PDF brochures to structured JSON
3. Scrape public yacht listings (legally)
4. Manual entry for initial testing

### 2. Real Customer Inquiry Testing

**Test Scenarios:**
```json
// Scenario 1: Mediterranean Family Charter
{
  "email": "sarah.johnson@email.com",
  "name": "Sarah Johnson", 
  "notes": "Looking for a luxury yacht in the French Riviera for our family of 6, including 2 teenagers. We want water sports equipment and prefer modern yachts. Budget around â‚¬100,000 per week.",
  "partySize": 6,
  "location": "French Riviera",
  "dates": "July 15-22, 2024",
  "budget": 100000
}

// Scenario 2: Caribbean Corporate Event
{
  "email": "events@techcorp.com",
  "name": "Michael Chen",
  "notes": "Corporate retreat for 20 executives in the Caribbean. Need professional catering capabilities and conference facilities. Budget flexible.",
  "partySize": 20,
  "location": "Caribbean",
  "dates": "March 2024",
  "budget": 200000
}

// Scenario 3: Bahamas Weekend Getaway
{
  "email": "party@weekend.com", 
  "name": "Jessica Miller",
  "notes": "Weekend party yacht in Bahamas for 8 friends. Looking for fun atmosphere with good music system and outdoor spaces.",
  "partySize": 8,
  "location": "Bahamas", 
  "dates": "Memorial Day weekend",
  "budget": 75000
}
```

### 3. SMTP Integration Testing

**Gmail Configuration:**
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=yacht.automate.test@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
FROM_NAME=Yacht Charter Automation
FROM_EMAIL=yacht.automate.test@gmail.com
```

**Testing Process:**
1. Configure Gmail SMTP with app password
2. Submit test leads to trigger emails
3. Verify professional email formatting
4. Test CC functionality to charter company
5. Confirm email deliverability to various providers

**Email Template Validation:**
- Subject line optimization for open rates
- Mobile-responsive email design  
- Professional branding and styling
- Clear yacht information and pricing
- Call-to-action buttons for booking

### 4. Performance Testing

**Load Testing Script:**
```bash
# Test concurrent lead submissions
for i in {1..50}; do
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/lead" \
    -H "X-Tenant-Id: test-client" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "$(cat test-lead-$((i%5)).json)" &
done
wait
```

**Metrics to Measure:**
- Response time under load
- Memory usage during peak processing
- Database performance with large yacht inventories
- Email queue processing speed
- Error rates under stress

### 5. End-to-End Workflow Validation

**Complete Customer Journey Test:**
1. Customer submits inquiry via website form
2. System receives POST request to /lead endpoint
3. Yacht matching algorithm processes inventory
4. Quote calculation with APA/VAT for top matches
5. Email template populated with yacht details
6. Professional email sent to customer and CC to company
7. Lead status updated in database
8. Event logged for audit trail

**Success Criteria:**
- < 60 seconds from inquiry to email delivery
- Accurate yacht matching based on criteria
- Correct pricing calculations for all regions
- Professional email formatting
- 100% data integrity in database
- Complete audit trail maintained

### 6. Multi-Tenant Isolation Testing

**Data Separation Validation:**
```bash
# Create two test tenants
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/admin/tenant" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: yacht-brain-prod-2025-secure-key" \
  -d '{"id": "company-a", "name": "Charter Company A"}'

curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/admin/tenant" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: yacht-brain-prod-2025-secure-key" \
  -d '{"id": "company-b", "name": "Charter Company B"}'

# Upload different yacht inventories to each
# Submit leads to both tenants
# Verify complete data isolation
# Confirm no cross-tenant data leakage
```

## Expected Outcomes

**System Validation:**
- Yacht matching accuracy > 90%
- Email delivery rate > 99%
- Response time < 1 second average
- Zero cross-tenant data exposure
- 100% quote calculation accuracy

**Business Validation:**
- Charter companies see immediate value
- Customers receive professional experience
- Lead conversion rates improve measurably
- System handles real-world data complexity
- Scalable architecture confirmed
