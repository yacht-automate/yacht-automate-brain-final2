I have an API system for a yacht charter automation brain already running in Replit. 
It works with tenants, demo yachts, lead capture, and quote calculation. 
Now I need to take it from "demo-ready" to "sell-ready."

Do ALL of the following steps for me, one by one, explaining clearly as you go, and 
showing me the exact code, file paths, or Replit UI clicks I need. 
Don’t skip anything or assume I know — I want everything in one flow.

### 1. Security
- Rotate the default ADMIN_KEY to a long random value stored in Replit Secrets, not code.
- Confirm all admin routes require this key.
- Add simple rate-limiting to prevent spam (per-IP limit).
- Lock down CORS to my domain (e.g. yachtautomate.com).

### 2. SMTP Email
- Help me connect SMTP using a real provider (Resend, SendGrid, or Gmail SMTP for testing).
- Update .env with `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `FROM_NAME`, `FROM_EMAIL`.
- Show me how to send a test inquiry and confirm it arrives in my inbox.
- Add SPF/DKIM/DMARC instructions so emails don’t land in spam.

### 3. Demo Data Purge
- Ensure demo yacht seeding only happens in the “demo” tenant.
- Disable auto-seeding of demo yachts in production.
- Show me how to seed real client yachts from CSV or JSON.

### 4. Automation Workflow
- Ensure new leads automatically:
   1) Save to database
   2) Trigger yacht matching
   3) Calculate indicative quote
   4) Email results to prospect + CC charter company
- Show me how to test this workflow end-to-end.

### 5. Deploy Always-On
- Configure Replit Deploys so the API runs 24/7 at a stable URL.
- Show me where to copy the public URL that I give to clients.
- Confirm endpoints respond from that public URL (not localhost).

### 6. Monitoring & Logs
- Enable error logging and simple alerts (email/Discord) when the server crashes.
- Show me how to tail logs in Replit.

### 7. Backups
- Create a daily SQLite export routine (or advise migrating to a hosted DB).
- Store backups in Replit storage or export them.

### 8. Onboarding New Clients
- Give me a repeatable process:
   - Create a new tenant
   - Upload their yacht list
   - Configure SMTP for their domain
   - Send test lead
   - Hand over API URL + simple integration guide

### 9. Legal Pages
- Generate a minimal Privacy Policy and Terms of Service file 
(plain text or HTML) that I can host from the API root (`/privacy`, `/terms`).

### 10. Final Checklist
- Confirm all 10 items (above) are “YES” and I am genuinely sell-ready.

Output should include:
- File changes (with code snippets)
- Replit UI steps (Secrets, Deploys, Logs)
- Example curl commands to verify each step
- Example email received in inbox
- Final checklist marked ✅ or ❌

Do not stop early. Walk me through all 10 steps until everything is complete.
