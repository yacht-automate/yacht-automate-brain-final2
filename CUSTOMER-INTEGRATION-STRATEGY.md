## Common Customer Questions

### "How does this integrate with our existing website?"
**Answer**: "We add a yacht inquiry form to your website that connects directly to the automation system. Customers see your branding, but the system handles everything automatically."

### "What if our technical team needs to customize it?"
**Answer**: "The API is fully documented with complete integration examples. Your developers can customize the user experience while the automation handles yacht matching and quotes."

### "Can we use our existing email system?"
**Answer**: "Absolutely. The system uses your SMTP credentials to send emails from your domain with your branding. Customers receive emails from you, not us."

### "What about our current yacht inventory management?"
**Answer**: "We upload your existing inventory and provide tools to keep it updated. You control all yacht data, pricing, and availability."
