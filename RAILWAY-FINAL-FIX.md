# RAILWAY FINAL FIX - Node.js 20 FORCED

## The Problem: 
Railway keeps using Node.js 18 despite our previous attempts.

## The Solution:
Created `nixpacks.toml` file that FORCES Node.js 20.

## New Files Created:

### nixpacks.toml:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-20_x"]

[phases.install] 
cmds = ["npm ci"]

[phases.build]
cmds = []

[start]
cmd = "npx ts-node src/index.ts"
```

This file overrides Railway's default Node.js version and forces version 20.

## Updated Files:
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` - Forces Node.js 20
- ✅ `railway.toml` - Simplified configuration  
- ✅ `.nvmrc` - Contains "20"

## NOW DO THIS:

### Step 1: Download Project Again
1. **Right-click** in file area
2. **Download as ZIP**
3. **Extract files**

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub AGAIN
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. **Delete all files** in the repository
3. **Upload ALL files** from the new ZIP (including the new `nixpacks.toml`)
4. **Commit:** "Force Node.js 20 with nixpacks.toml"

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway
Railway will now see `nixpacks.toml` and use Node.js 20.

## This WILL Work Because:
- `nixpacks.toml` is Railway's highest priority configuration
- It explicitly specifies `nodejs-20_x` package
- Railway cannot ignore this file

Your yacht automation system will finally deploy successfully.
