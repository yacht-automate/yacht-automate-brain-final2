   NODE_ENV=production
   ADMIN_KEY=demo-yacht-brain-2025
   ALLOWED_DOMAIN=*
   ```
5. **Get your demo URL**: `https://your-project.railway.app`

## Step 2: Create Sales Presentation

### Demo Script (3-Minute Pitch):
**"Let me show you how your next yacht inquiry gets processed..."**

1. **Show Problem**: "Currently, this lead sits in your inbox for hours"
2. **Submit Live Lead**: Use this exact request:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "client@example.com",
     "name": "John Smith",
     "notes": "Looking for Mediterranean yacht for 8 guests, budget â‚¬150k",
     "partySize": 8,
     "location": "Mediterranean",
     "budget": 150000
   }
   ```
3. **Show Results**: "In 2 seconds, system found 4 perfect matches"
4. **Show Quote**: "Automatic APA/VAT calculation: â‚¬186,750 total"
5. **Show Email**: "Professional response sent immediately"

### ROI Calculator:

### Contact Strategy:
1. **LinkedIn**: Target yacht charter company owners/managers
2. **Industry Events**: Yacht shows, charter exhibitions
3. **Cold Email**: "Cut your lead response time from 4 hours to 60 seconds"
4. **Referrals**: Satisfied customers refer competitors

### Demo Booking Email Template:
```
